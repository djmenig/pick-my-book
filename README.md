# Pick My Book

This webapp was created for the Udemy Complete Web Development Boot Camp by Angela Yu for the "Use a Public API" Capstone Project.

*Pick My Book* is a simple web app that picks a random book based on user-specified criteria. Currently, the user may pick from a list of subjects, and once submitted, the app searches through a random chunk of 100 borrowable books, and then selects one at random.  

Open Library is the chosen API for this project: https://openlibrary.org/developers/api
